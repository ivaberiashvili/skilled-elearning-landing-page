## My process
This was my first "proper" project and yes it took me a lot more than I expected. When things got complex I had to bring in style variables and think about the architecture of my CSS.
Overall, I spent around ~30h on this project, but I consider it well spent as I learned a lot on the side, which will vastly improve my workflow for the next projects.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
- I experienced what I already knew: that the importance of your code's architecture increases with the complexity of the project.
- The most challenging part was working with responsive images, which I did over and over again with different methods in this project and I believe I understood it better.

### Continued development
There are other several other Frontend Mentor projects on my TO-DO list. 
This will probably be my [next project](https://github.com/ivaberiashvili/art-gallery-website).

### Useful resources

- [Mdn Web Docs > CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background) - This is extremely helpful resource with real time examples.
